I work in Amex Burgess Hill and on 21-Dec-16, parked my car at 0930 about halfway up on Crescent Road (near door no 31). 
I entered from civic way and parked in left facing Mill Road & went to office. When I returned in evening around 1635 there 
was a note & rear view mirror cover on my windshield and a number of scratches near from right headlamp. As I was late 
for an appointment, I collected everything & left for home and emailed sussex police once I reached home.

Next day I visited Burgess Hill Police Station, who gave me more details they received from 2 witnesses, as:

About 10:45 a white luton van with sticker Empire Laundry & registration starting BDI3 hit my car & failed to stop. 
Witness couldnt see the driver but noticed a 020 contact number on Van/Lorry, understanding its London based. Once lorry 
hurried off, they checked if it hit any other cars on the street and found none others with damage and called 101 giving 
car/accident details.

I got contact information of Empire Laundry from Police & contacted them; they asked time to check and later gave me 
several calls asking about the accident and after several days told me it wasnt their van. They said their vans 
do not go to Burgess Hill and they dont have any starting with registration BD03 (although I didnt tell them we only have 
partial reg number).

I also visited Johnson The Cleaners, which is very close to Crescent Road to know if they are aware of Empire Laundry. However they declined saying they dont work with them.
