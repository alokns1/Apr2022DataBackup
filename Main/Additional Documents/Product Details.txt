	- Maybe make payment by using it as a reader and read restos QR code from resto's app on FL3's mobile

	- Validate bank card number using bank's API & await validation
	- If all OK, setup BPC with 10000 Rs (or as agreed) worth bank credit points & then allow any other cards to be added as well

	- The new balance should be available to use instantly. No cashback on EMI transactions.
	- Bank to credit BS share by end of 3rd day from transaction, even if the collection from BPC is pending their recovery cycle. Bank to make BPC collections 	  	  based on their own pay cycle arrangement.

Recording? Add scroller to show infringement but allow copying & sharing.
Should we take live feedback from live customer to drive the kind of songs they should sing?

Separate local & national whatson

Live streaming : By FL3
	- For any events happening at FL3 estabishment e.g. live band, games, singers, FL3 should have access to live stream that events to its remote customers
	- Advance promotions should be published to let users register for online or physical attendance. Charge seed money for physical attendance and on-demand for 	  	  online customers.
	- Need to finalize how we need to charge user and if so, on what basis e.g. videos watched, period, per event, Fl3 subscription, all of these etc.
	- As subscribed, FL4 to view the live events during the live play only. Play quality dependent on FL4's internet service, so maybe run a background check to 		  tell FL4 their bandwidth and prompt if it's low. This would avoid concerns about bad impression of the app itself. Same for FL3.
	- For personal events like bday party or similar, can FL3 stream?
	- What can go wrong here??????


Live streaming : By FL4
	- For private events like bday party, anniversary cake cutting or similar, FL4 to make specific request to FL3
	- FL3 to approve the streaming request for a set period e.g. 4 hours after providing approval. FL3 should have an option to cancel streaming if FL4 is making 		  inappropriate video & raise a ticket.
	- Live streaming agreement should explicitely say either FL3 or FL4 can cancel the streaming for all or specific users, if inappropriate content is being 	  	  shared.
	- Once approved, FL4 should be able to do live video streaming without showing any other sensitive FL3 information or other customers in the video. FL4 should 		  be able to publish this stream to selective customers only, based on selection by known phone numbers.
	- A notification should go to each receiver FL4 customer on their BS app zoom
	- Receiver FL4 should be able to simply accept the live stream request & view it without recording. For recording, they may try to use a different phone to 		  record, which we should try & discourage or prohibit under proprietary & copyright infringement law. If something wrong happens and the video ends up on 	  	  youtube, there could be a legal risk.
	- Publishing FL4 should be able to end the live stream as & when needed and for selective viewers too. Viewing FL4 should also be able to end streaming when 	  	  ready.
	- The streaming mobile should be able to use front or back camera.
	- Can there be a situation where FL4 needs to do stream to general public?  E.g when he isnt able to find the phone number ?


Delivery: FL4
	- Delivery module to be exclusively available on the FL3 & FL4 app
	- Customer to go into delivery section and see all restaurants that are ready to order. The information should show name, menu type, offers, rating, V/NV
	- Chen clicked, show if oper for delivery, top/best items, expected delivery time to customer location
	- See all menu items with cost & photo with option to add to cart and categorized by type e.g. starter, snacks, dessert etc
	- Provide option to select by category to jump to specific section e.g. drinks or dessert
	- Show best combination based on selection (as provided by FL3)
	- Show total costs including everything and show highlighted discount, if any
	- options for promo code, contactless delivery, leave at door or main gate, cutlery, customize etc.
	- Show final bill and take payment in points or money?
	- Show order confirmation once payment is done. Then confirmation by FL3 should show up too, to show order is being prepared, to start the delivery clock.
	- Update wallet balance immediately with usual notifications
	- app-popup notification on each stage of delivery, not sms
	- Show delivery tracking too and ask to rate delivery quality & food quality separately, when delivery is complete
	- Save delivery information in orders page for 3 months. On clicking order summary, show basic order details like datetime, content, card used, any photos you 	  	  clicked etc.
	- Customer should have option to shortlist any restos that they like and be able to repeat order
	- Customer should be able to search for a particular item based on multiple popular names of same dish e.g. malai paneer, malai panir, malaai paneer etc.
	- Find a way to store patterns in their orders and show restos sorted based on these preferences
	- There should be an option to receive messages directly from resto, in case order is delayed, stuck, cancelled etc. Based on this, a refund option needs to be 	  opened up.?????? Or any other options like doordash
	- Possible group order function??
	

Delivery Restos:
	- Restos should be able to turn delivery on/off and must honor their active orders. If delayed, there should be an option to let the customer know.

	- Along with name, its cost, discount (calc final cost), dish of the day/bestseller/speciality/extended prep time/New/hot/spicy/eggless/veg-nveg-egg/out of 		  stock tags (max 5), custom description must be provided. If out of stock, grey out from ordering menu.
	- Delete option must be there to remove from menu permanently and maintain a deleed items log. Ask for reason to remove.
	- Option to automate start/pause/end based on the day, holiday etc, so that orders are received only during active periods. Option to alter the timing on 
	  ad-hoc should also be provided e.g. closed on dry day or monday afternoons etc. Possibly give calendar functions too.
	- Start and end date to be selected when publishing the finalized menu. Start date might usually be contract start date and default end date 31-Dec-9999. The 		  end date to be updated when resto leaves the contract. This might be handy also for exclusivity agreement.
	- Upon receipt of order, show a prompt to FL3 app and allow option to accept order. Fl3 to check the kitchen status and accept the order. Acceptance prompt 	  	  goes to the customer too.
	- Once order is ready, courier to pick it & change status to picked. Once picked, map tracking should follow. Once courier is at destination-sh, change status 	  	  to reached and open option to call the customer? Or maybe just message their arrival for customer to call. Somehow try not to share the phone number but no  		  worries if we cant achieve that in MVP.
	- Once order is delivered, change status to delivered and let courier rate the customer. Similarly customer to rate food & delivery speed, packaging, quality 	  	  etc. This is important for our SOP guidance.
	- Possibly support group order?
	- Does map tracking needs to be in app or can simply be passed to google maps?
	- Option to stop prompts of the order requests - for owners etc. so that only 

General on Delivery:

	- Delivery packaging aspect to be clarified & decided - likely cost impact
	- Always have picture

	- Restos should have option to choose drink name and only in case of bespoke name should have a need to provide name of drink. BS must approve the name.

	- Delete option must be there to remove from menu permanently and maintain a deleted items log. Ask for reason to remove
	- Maybe also show description of the drink when clicked. FOr in-house drink, the description needs to be created by FL3 & approved by BS admin.
	
FL3 Events: BS sponsored
	- Dedicated page for all FL3s to choose from a variety of event packages and referentual costs, so that BS isnt bombed with random unsure or curious queries.
	- FL3 to choose from the packages based in the knowledge of their customer. Or for sheer experimentation.
	- FL3 to provide basic details like available facilities, indoor/outdoor space, time, day, period, prospective customer count, wifi, power type, expense limit.
	- BS to revert back with a range of offers via email, phone etc and work out the finer details. Including anonymous info on artists e.g. 7 years experience in 		  singing, 5 instrument band etc. Maybe a sample of past performance of the artists too, without revealing personal information.
	- FL3 to finalize, transfer non-refundable seed money (x% or somehow, points or money) to confirm a specific offering. Maybe for regular requestors, this seed 		  money to be waived off but then how will we earn or support the artist app? Somehow charge per customer?
	- Offer artists alterntives to FL3 after seed money is paid and maybe even promote less demanded artist for lower cost, in case the other one is high in 		  demand.
	- BS to arrange for the service, somehow pay advance to artists (50%) and rest after the event and possibly patch the 2 parties to work together.
	- Define BS's role, once the parties are patched together and exclusivity arrangement for 18 months from the latest performance. If arrangement is broken, levy 	  35% fees for such an event to both parties. or something like that. Possibly ban the artist for 1 year from BS as otherwise it will give weak reputation.
	WHAT IS BS ADMIN SCREWS UP AND PATCHES ARTIST & FL3 FOR A FEE??
	- Advertise to FL4 as well & charge online streamning customer to share the earnings with FL3. Share 67:33 for online users. WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING 	  THE VIDEO IN GOOD QUALITY FOR STREAMING? HAS TO BE FL3 SO GIVE THEM 33%
	- Maybe take online customer request of songs too?

FL3 Events: Their own sponsored
	- FL3 to provide all details like artists, facilities, indoor/outdoor space, time, day, period, prospective customer count, seating capacity, wifi, power type, 	  etc. for BS to promote, whether to archive or not.
	- BS to revert back with a range of offers via email, phone etc and work out the finer details.

	- BS to put it up on whatson and take registrations & streaming requests. Seed cost for physical attendance registrations. Share this fees with Fl3 as 75:25.
	- For online streaming viewers, share 50:50 wth FL3. Figure this out based on streaming operation costs.
	- FL3 should be responsible for streaming the video & BS to store it for quality check. If there are complaints from users, we might need to consider refund 	  	  from FL3 to cover BS and FL4 costs.
	- MUST TAKE ONLINE VIEWER REVIEW OF THE EVENT TO ASCERTAIN SOME ODD CUSTOMERS ARENT JUST TRYING TO GET THE MONEY BACK BY COMPLAINING FALSELY. This is where BS 	  	  storage of the event will help validation.
	
BS artist collections:
	- Need a sister app to collect info on artists, their expertise, costing, calendar, sample work etc.

Even the most celebrated restaurants in India struggle with profitability
https://qz.com/india/1782006/indias-top-restaurants-like-olive-comorin-struggle-with-profits/

April 15, 2020, 18:10 IST
https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/corporate-news/the-indian-restaurant-industry-will-never-be-the-same/75157663
Most restaurants in India and around the world work on slim 10%-15% EBITDA margins with hardly three weeks of cash flow
This industry contributes around 3% to the GDP of India and is its single largest employer with more than 73 lakhs people on its payrolls
For instance, in China where average dining out instances is 28 per month, Dominos is operating at 30% of its pre-COVID business even after the situation is back to normal. In India with just 4.1 average dining out per month, the impact is likely to be as bad if not worse. Besides diner’s concerns around health & sanitation, the economic slowdown will also hamper consumer spending in the short term.
 With popular restaurants likely to be operating at 50 percent or less of total capacity to ensure social distancing, apps that offer diners online reservation and pre-ordering and wait list management that help minimize table turn-times, further shortening the queue of people waiting to be served will prove to be critical

India is also one of the largest consumer markets globally, and one of the youngest with more than 45% of the population under 25 years old. For teens and young adults, eating out is a popular form of socializing, contributing to the growth of multiple segments within the expanding market.

According to data from the Economist Intelligence Unit, personal disposable income should grow about 10.5% annually through 2020.

India’s traditional close-knit extended families are less common; as younger family members move away for education and jobs, they are setting up smaller households, making dining out more attractive. More women are joining the workforce as well, especially in urban areas, leaving less time for home cooking and creating more demand for dining out/takeout options.

In India, full-service restaurants command the largest market share, at 57% of sales. The next biggest category is QSR, at about 16%.

As international, national, and regional players move into the market the momentum is shifting toward more chain-affiliated and standardized operations. A value-seeking mentality (to be expected, with median household income around USD 4,000 in 2015), marketing, greater mobility, and social media will all fuel more demand for QSRs.

Geographically, the prime opportunities are in the urban centers, where higher wages are attracting more Indians. By 2020, it’s estimated that 36% of India’s population will be urban dwellers, up from 32% currently.

 The country’s robust economic growth and rising household incomes are
expected to increase consumer spending to US$3.6 trillion by 2020, with the maximum consumer spend likely
to occur in the food, household and transport and communication segments. India’s share of global
consumption is also forecast to increase to more than twice its current levels by 2020. Over the next five years,
India’s retail market is expected to reach US$1 trillion. The e-commerce market is expected to reach US$125
billion in terms of gross merchandise value (GMV), growing at the rate of 31%, and it is estimated that the food
service industry will grow at a pace of 10.8% and cross the US$161 billion mark by 2020.1

With rising incomes, the propensity to spend is now expanding beyond metros to Tier II and Tier III cities, which
are turning into new demand centres. However, the products, price points and consumption experience
expectations of these consumers are very different from those of consumers in metros. The model of serving
consumer demand that works in metros may not work in Tier II and Tier III cities.

 As such, most business managers have not
proactively devoted time to developing even a basic appreciation of how emerging technology can solve some
of their customers’ problems. That is set to change. With the market cap of new age companies having
surpassed that of several large traditional players, technology’s new role is now being acknowledged. It is a
disruptive force that can pivot business models to serve customers in a manner unthinkable before. From
mobile usage to internet of things to artificial intelligence, technology is causing major changes in how
consumers order their food.

 Demand for processed /convenience food is constantly increasing. 

The performance of the foodservice industry is forecast to accelerate, with an anticipated CAGR of 10% for
the five-year period 2017–2022. This is expected to drive the industry to a value of INR 5,52,000 crore by the
end of 2022.
