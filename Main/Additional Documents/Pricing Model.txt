FL4: Pricing structure

1. Download - Free
2. Initial registration - Free
3. KYC check - Free (Expense 21 Rs) - For failed checks need to add validation, confirmation, cannot be changed without making payment of Rs50.
4. Sharing - (Apply service charge of 10% + GST 18% ?? - Note: 10% of SC goes to govt) 
	- No initial credits/deposit - Minimum deposit of 500 to restrict resistance towards paying too much initial amount for FL4 to use app 
	- App will charge the FL3 5% (?? TBC) of the app based sale as we are increasing frequency of FL4 visit to FL3.
5. Purchase expiration (Read Expiry Algorithm below) & extension - On extention change money or reduce cost

Think about tab & afterpay

5.1: No service tax on buying drink for self

6. Sharing - "No transfer fee" - Reciever validity to match sender's expiration initially.
Point reduction every time after initial transfer
Penalty for delay/cascaded transfer - 5-10% (same as sharing) plus another 5%

5. Offering - ($$ 65% ??) - display (Rs 10k expense) but charge setup cost e.g. $$ Rs 15k.
	- Charge 100% extra due to the premium service to offer
	- Highlight offer point specifically for payment, reimbursement
	- how to make FL4 redeem offer points in the same FL3? Or should be able to redeem anywhere?
	- Refund: not possible as payment will be done after the service
	- offer points:
		- Offer point should cost the sender double but be credited as single drink to receiver
		- Offering FL3 should get some immediate benefit of the offers made in his establishment
		- Then offer points can be redemeed anywhere and share 20% its benefit with redemeeing FL3
		- offer points to have same validity as same sharing point??
