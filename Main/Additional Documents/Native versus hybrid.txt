Native:
 - cost 1.3
cons:
	- separate coding by OS
	- Mobile resources can be used e.g. gallery, nfc
	- API based, therefore faster
	- Everything is bound at the time of build, so download time is longer and takes more space. but usage time is lower
	- Enhancements is better as has all support & all APIs are compatible

Hybrid: Works at application layer

	- Same code 
Cons:
	- Does not support all APIs for native and require external plugin
	- Mobile res cant be used without plugin
	- HTML5, CSS etc based
	- Doesnt require lot of resources while downloading so quick to startup, but for usage it lags as stars pulling plugsings from net
	- Enhancements need to recompile & deply for every change and may not even work seamlessly
