In GST, these things are treated a vouchers in mobile linked accounts
Voucher will carry the 3% GST amount at the time of issue of voucher - If person is aware what they will use it for
No GST - if the persons doesnt know where they will use it for but the GST will be charged on the purchase.

closed vouchers
- redemeed in issuing entity only

Open vouchers
- can be redemeed anywhere e.g. sodexo owned partner merchants

Semi closed
- need to redeem at partner merchants but dont know what for e.g. food, drink or gift

So we dont need to pay GST - its like tender we will 
RBI master circular - prepaid payment instruments (PPI) - we need to take auth from RBI for issuing this kind of instrument

FL3 will charge their regular GST - 

1000 Rs - 1100 RsPoints - 
5000 goods - GST300 - total 5300
Customer to pay 1100 from BS wallet and 4200 from card

Option 2:
When I spend 2000 points, I will get 200

Option 3:
For part payment through BS - how will the bill be followed - 
goods cost was 4000 and after including GST final billing is 4200 
BS - 3000 & cash 1200 -> FL3/24K wallet 3000 points - Customer 300 points
BS 3000 & buys 1200 points - 4200 - FL3 - Mobiquick wallet has promo - if paid through mobi wallet, customer gets 5% discount?

We need to charge 18% on the service - ??? 
4200+756SC then 18% GST on this value = 892
to pay FL3 = 4200-892=3308

4000+720SC + GST 850
to pay FL3 = 4000-850=3150

Q:
Purchased points should only be made available to be used after 24 hours? Policy decision so think about to get committed customers.
Think more about it.
Maybe enable the cashback points after 24 hours to be used by customer??
